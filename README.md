# Gesture-Volume-Controller-OpenCV-
In this Project, We Utilized computer vision techniques to detect and track hand gestures in real-time through a webcam. We also Implemented different algorithms to identify specific hand gestures that corresponded to volume control commands, such as increasing or decreasing the volume.
